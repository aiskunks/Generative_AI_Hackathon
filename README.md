## About the Generative AI Hackathon  

_Mission_

Our mission for the Generative AI Hackathon is to provide a platform where students can showcase their talent, develop their skills, and unleash their creativity using AI technologies. Encouraging students to explore novel applications and solutions. We aspire to stimulate innovation not only in the realm of generative AI, but also extending - but not limited - to diverse fields such as Data Science, Visual Design, Software Engineering, and Biomedical studies.

_Vision_  

Our vision for the Generative AI Hackathon is to propel the advancement of generative AI by cultivating a dynamic platform where emerging talent meets industry opportunity. We envision this Hackathon as a springboard for students to showcase their skills, apply their academic knowledge, and ultimately attract career opportunities in the ever-evolving AI landscape.



_What projects can be done in Hackathon?_  


Text Generation: Projects could involve creating a model capable of generating human-like text based on prompts. This could be further specified into generating poetry, stories, or even specific styles of writing like Shakespearean text.
Image Synthesis: Generative AI models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), can be used to generate realistic images, designs, or artworks. This could involve creating a model that generates images of people, landscapes, or specific objects that do not exist in the real world.  

Music Composition: Generative AI can also be used to compose music. A project could focus on training a model to compose music in the style of a particular genre, band, or artist.

Deepfake Creation: Another application of generative AI is in the creation of deepfakes. This involves generating realistic and convincing images or videos of humans by swapping their faces or altering their expressions and movements.

Chatbots: Generative models can be used to improve the quality of chatbot or virtual assistant responses. Instead of relying on predefined responses, a generative AI chatbot can provide more nuanced and contextual responses, improving user interaction.

Data Augmentation: Generative AI can be used to generate synthetic data that can be used to supplement real data in various machine learning tasks. This can be particularly useful in situations where data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

Predictive Modeling: In the field of biomedical science, generative models can be used to predict the 3D structures of proteins or the effects of genetic mutations. This could potentially contribute to the development of new drugs and treatments

_Hackathon Judging Criteria_   

The following are the key criteria which will be used by the judges to evaluate the projects developed during the Generative AI Hackathon: 

Innovation and Creativeness: Judges will assess the level of innovation and creativity demonstrated in the solution. Is it a unique idea, or does it present an existing one with a novel twist? Does the solution challenge the norm and rethink traditional approaches to solving problems? Judges will favor projects that reflect original thinking and display a creative approach to problem-solving using generative AI. 

Impact: The potential impact of the solution will be another critical criterion. Will the solution have a positive effect on society, a business, a particular demographic, etc.? Judges will look for projects that have the potential to make a significant and tangible impact, addressing real-world challenges or needs effectively. 

Business Value: Judges will also examine the solution from a business perspective. They will evaluate the potential market for the solution. Can this idea generate revenue or at least contribute to a solution that will? The ability to convert an innovative idea into a marketable product or service that brings value to customers will be a key consideration. Presentation and 

Demonstration: Finally, the team's ability to present and demonstrate their project effectively will be evaluated. This includes both the clarity of the presentation and the effectiveness of the demonstration. Teams need to articulate their ideas clearly, explain the technical details in an understandable manner, demonstrate the functioning of their solution effectively, and highlight its benefits convincingly. 

Design: A well-designed object, system, or solution typically possesses the following characteristics:

- Functionality: The design should perform its primary function or purpose effectively, meeting the needs and requirements of its users. It should accomplish its goals without unnecessary complexity or confusion.  

- Usability: The design should be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for people to interact with and understand. Users should be able to navigate and use the design with minimal effort or frustration.  

- Aesthetics: Aesthetics play a crucial role in design, as visually appealing designs tend to be more inviting and attractive to users. A well-designed object or interface can evoke positive emotions and create a sense of satisfaction.   

- Simplicity: Good design often follows the principle of simplicity. Unnecessary elements or complexities are eliminated to achieve a cleaner and more straightforward design, which enhances usability and user experience.  

- Consistency: A well-designed system or product maintains a consistent look, feel, and behavior throughout its various components. Consistency helps users develop a mental model of how the design works, reducing confusion and making it easier to learn and use. 

- Accessibility: A well-designed solution considers the diverse needs of its users and strives to be accessible to all, including individuals with disabilities or special requirements.  

= Innovation: Well-designed solutions often incorporate innovative ideas or creative approaches to solve problems or meet users' needs more effectively.  

- Contextual Fit: A design is well-suited when it aligns with the specific context in which it will be used. Understanding the user's environment and needs helps create a design that feels natural and fits seamlessly into their lives.  

 

By considering these criteria, judges will ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the projects ranking each for the above on a scale of 1 to 5, assessing not just the technical capabilities of the participants but also their creativity, strategic thinking, and presentation skills.



## Step 0 - Collaboration and Folder

Please have a team member add GitHub ID as a collaborator to this repository.  You will create a subfolder for your team.  The judges will be instructed to incorporate how well your repository is organized and commented in their final scores.

## Step 1 - The Anatomy of Prompts

The goal is not just to generate useful visualizations and designs, but to generate code and rules that can generate many designs for a particular purpose. You can prompt however you want but this approach generated stunning results. You can see examples at the Computational Art Lab IG [https://www.instagram.com/artlabneu/](https://www.instagram.com/artlabneu/) and the Skunks.ai IG [https://www.instagram.com/skunks.ai/](https://www.instagram.com/skunks.ai/).  


Think of a prompt as a sequence of tags and categorize all the tags into four meta-categories:

1) Subject  
2) Style  
3) Composition   
4) Boosters  

Refer to the image below for an illustration of the prompt structure:

## Step 2 - Generating Tag List Set
To generate a tag list set for your chosen topic, utilize the following resources:

* ChatGPT/Bard  
* Kaggle Datasets: [https://www.kaggle.com/nikbearbrown/datasets ](https://www.kaggle.com/nikbearbrown/datasets)  
* Private Datasets
* Begin with the 55K Midjourney Tags in a Topic Taxonomy dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikbearbrown/55k-midjourney-tags-in-a-topic-taxonomy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikbearbrown/55k-midjourney-tags-in-a-topic-taxonomy)  

Follow the "Tag, Categories" style when categorizing the tags. For example:

Tag: yoji shinkawa

Categories:

1971 births, Konami people, Japanese illustrators, Living people, Video game artists

_Please upvote any datasets that you find useful._

Organize your tagset within the appropriate GitHub directory. For instance, if your topic is Game Art, place the tags in the "Tags" folder within the "Game_art" subdirectory.

## Step 3 - Prompt Engineering Experiments

Conduct prompt engineering experiments for your topic and document the results in a Jupyter notebook. Treat the notebook as a journal to record your experiments, including images with well-crafted prompts for your topic.

Ensure that all images are placed in the "Images" subdirectory and are renamed using the alpha_numeric_opt.py script before uploading them to GitHub. See [https://github.com/aiskunks/zebonastic/tree/main/PYZ](https://github.com/aiskunks/zebonastic/tree/main/PYZ)

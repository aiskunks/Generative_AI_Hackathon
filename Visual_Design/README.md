# OPT Instructions

Please follow these OPT reporting instructions carefully.  

## Step 0 - Collaboration
Please add your GitHub ID as a collaborator to this repository.

## Step 1 - Topic Selection
The goal is to conduct useful research on creating prompts for specific kinds of images.

Think of a prompt as a sequence of tags and categorize all the tags into four meta-categories:

1) Subject  
2) Style  
3) Composition   
4) Boosters  

Refer to the image below for an illustration of the prompt structure:

## Step 2 - Generating Tag List Set
To generate a tag list set for your chosen topic, utilize the following resources:

* ChatGPT/Bard  
* Kaggle Datasets: [https://www.kaggle.com/nikbearbrown/datasets ](https://www.kaggle.com/nikbearbrown/datasets)  
* Private Datasets
* Begin with the 55K Midjourney Tags in a Topic Taxonomy dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikbearbrown/55k-midjourney-tags-in-a-topic-taxonomy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikbearbrown/55k-midjourney-tags-in-a-topic-taxonomy)  

Follow the "Tag, Categories" style when categorizing the tags. For example:

Tag: yoji shinkawa

Categories:

1971 births, Konami people, Japanese illustrators, Living people, Video game artists

_Please upvote any datasets that you find useful._

Organize your tagset within the appropriate GitHub directory. For instance, if your topic is Game Art, place the tags in the "Tags" folder within the "Game_art" subdirectory.

## Step 3 - Prompt Engineering Experiments

Conduct prompt engineering experiments for your topic and document the results in a Jupyter notebook. Treat the notebook as a journal to record your experiments, including images with well-crafted prompts for your topic.

Ensure that all images are placed in the "Images" subdirectory and are renamed using the alpha_numeric_opt.py script before uploading them to GitHub. See [https://github.com/aiskunks/zebonastic/tree/main/PYZ](https://github.com/aiskunks/zebonastic/tree/main/PYZ)  

Rewrite the contents of the README.md files in a way that is relevant and coherent to your chosen topic.

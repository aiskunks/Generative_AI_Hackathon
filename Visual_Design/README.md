# Visual Design

If you don't have a lot of experience with generative AI it is recommended that you use prompt-based generative AI to create images for visual design.

Using prompt-based generative AI to create images opens up exciting possibilities for visual design. Prompt-based generative models, like GPT-3, DALL-E, Leanardo.ai or Midjounrey can be used to generate images based on textual descriptions or commands, allowing designers to ideate and explore various visual concepts in a creative and interactive manner.

The focus should be think of what types of concept sketching might be useful of the companies judging the hackathon: Microsoft, Phillips, Amazon, Vui.com, Gaia AI, and Squark AI.

* Concept Sketching: Designers can use natural language prompts to describe their visual ideas or concepts. The generative AI can then transform these textual descriptions into rough sketches or outlines, helping designers quickly visualize their thoughts on paper without the need for advanced drawing skills. This accelerates the concept generation process and allows for rapid iterations.   

* Branding, Poster and Logo Design: Designers can utilize generative AI to assist in logo creation or branding elements. They can describe their brand's personality, values, and target audience through prompts, and the AI can generate logos or visual brand assets that align with the specified characteristics. This can help in brand identity exploration and save time during the design process. 

* Storytelling and Visualization: Prompt-based generative models can be used to generate illustrations or visual elements for storytelling purposes. Authors, game developers, or filmmakers can provide descriptive prompts for scenes or characters, and the AI can produce corresponding images to enhance the narrative.  

* Product Prototyping and Visualization: Designers can leverage generative AI to create visualizations of product prototypes without having to go through the entire design process. By describing product features and design elements, the AI can produce images of potential product variations, aiding in decision-making and communication with stakeholders.   

* Data Visualization and Infographics: By providing data and information in text form, designers can utilize generative AI to create custom data visualizations or infographics. This can enhance the presentation of complex data and make it more accessible to a broader audience.    

While generative AI is a powerful tool for visual design, it is important to remember that it complements rather than replaces human creativity. Designers should use these AI-generated visuals as a starting point for inspiration, exploration, and ideation, refining and adding their personal touch to the final designs. Additionally, ethical considerations, transparency, and validation are essential when using AI in design, ensuring the generated content aligns with ethical guidelines and the brand's values.  

## Step 0 - Collaboration and Folder

Please have a team member add GitHub ID as a collaborator to this repository.  You will create a subfolder for your team.  The judges will be instructed to incorporate how well your repository is organized and commented in their final scores.

## Step 1 - The Anatomy of Prompts

The goal is not just to generate useful visualizations and designs, but to generate code and rules that can generate many designs for a particular purpose. You can prompt however you want but this approach generated stunning results. You can see examples at the Computational Art Lab IG [https://www.instagram.com/artlabneu/](https://www.instagram.com/artlabneu/) and the Skunks.ai IG [https://www.instagram.com/skunks.ai/](https://www.instagram.com/skunks.ai/).  


Think of a prompt as a sequence of tags and categorize all the tags into four meta-categories:

1) Subject  
2) Style  
3) Composition   
4) Boosters  

Refer to the image below for an illustration of the prompt structure:

## Step 2 - Generating Tag List Set
To generate a tag list set for your chosen topic, utilize the following resources:

* ChatGPT/Bard  
* Kaggle Datasets: [https://www.kaggle.com/nikbearbrown/datasets ](https://www.kaggle.com/nikbearbrown/datasets)  
* Private Datasets
* Begin with the 55K Midjourney Tags in a Topic Taxonomy dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikbearbrown/55k-midjourney-tags-in-a-topic-taxonomy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikbearbrown/55k-midjourney-tags-in-a-topic-taxonomy)  

Follow the "Tag, Categories" style when categorizing the tags. For example:

Tag: yoji shinkawa

Categories:

1971 births, Konami people, Japanese illustrators, Living people, Video game artists

_Please upvote any datasets that you find useful._

Organize your tagset within the appropriate GitHub directory. For instance, if your topic is Game Art, place the tags in the "Tags" folder within the "Game_art" subdirectory.

## Step 3 - Prompt Engineering Experiments

Conduct prompt engineering experiments for your topic and document the results in a Jupyter notebook. Treat the notebook as a journal to record your experiments, including images with well-crafted prompts for your topic.

Ensure that all images are placed in the "Images" subdirectory and are renamed using the alpha_numeric_opt.py script before uploading them to GitHub. See [https://github.com/aiskunks/zebonastic/tree/main/PYZ](https://github.com/aiskunks/zebonastic/tree/main/PYZ)  

Rewrite the contents of the README.md files in a way that is relevant and coherent to your chosen topi
